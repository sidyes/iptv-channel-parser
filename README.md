# IPTV Channel Parser

This is a free to use .py script to parse an .m3u channel list.

## Prerequisites
Open `iptv.py` and edit the following variables:
* `url`: Enter the URL / path to your .m3u channel list
* `tv_programs`: Add your desired TV channels by using their ID
* `group_title`: Change the title of this variable according to your desired TV channel group name

## How To
Just run `.\iptv.py` and the final channel list will be saved in `iptv.m3u`. 😀
